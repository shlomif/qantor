Correction: Qantor - Qantor Ain't No Tex/Troff, Oh, Really!

A typesetting system.

Goals:
------

1. Making all the things currently easy with TeX/LaTeX also easy.

2. Good support for internationalization, Unicode and BiDi.

3. Good support for Hypertext.

4. Easily processable and understandable. (So qantor won't be the only thing
that can understand Qantor).

5. Good support for incorporating media, mathematical equations, etc.

6. Easy to learn and master.

7. Turing complete and very flexible.

8. Meaningful, easy to understand errors.

9. No real need for TeX->LaTeX - usable as is.
