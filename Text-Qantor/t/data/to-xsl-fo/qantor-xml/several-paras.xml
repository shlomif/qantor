<p>
"Jenn, please come here. Jenn I'd like you to meet Eve Siegel, who likes to be
called 'Erisa'. Erisa, I told you about Jenn."
</p>
<p>
I looked at this Erisa character. Her hair was dyed purple, her face had too
much makeup, and her facial expression was horrid. Remember that episode in
"Sabrina - The Teenage Witch" where Sabrina transforms herself into a punk? She
looked only a bit better than that.
